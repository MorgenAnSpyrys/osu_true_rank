poorly written tool to do some screening shenanigans


to run add elitebotix /osu-host tournamenttopplays output csv path as arg 1, apiv1 key as arg 2


for elitebotix /osu-host tournamenttopplays, you MUST run it with amount:100 to get accurate results. I also HIGHLY recommend onlyranked:true, as some unranked maps that break pp are played in gimmick tournaments
