poorly written tool to do some screening shenanigans


to run add elitebotix /osu-host tournamenttopplays output csv path as arg 1, apiv1 key as arg 2


for elitebotix /osu-host tournamenttopplays, you MUST run it with amount:100 to get accurate results. I also HIGHLY recommend onlyranked:true, as some unranked maps that break pp are played in gimmick tournaments

i recommend defaulting to 416.6 bonus pp at runtime because derankers have artificially less bonus pp, but if you don't like that, that is an option as well
